## Intro to ABC and Logic Synthesis

1. Download abc from: [github](https://github.com/berkeley-abc/abc)
2. Read abc documentation from [webpage](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~alanmi/abc/)
3. Read 4 basic operations from [paper](./Papers/Scalable_Generic_Logic_Synthesis:_One_Approach_to_Rule_Them_All.pdf) and [paper](./Papers/Scalable_Logic_Synthesis_using_a_Simple_Circuit_Structure.pdf)

## Demo

1. Compile the verilog format circuit into an FPGA board.
2. Compare the performance difference between the best design and the worst design.
